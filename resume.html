                            <p>I am a high school student at the University of Chicago Laboratory High School, graduating in 2018, with a deep interest in science, engineering, and technology. I am familiar with entry-level coding and capable of teaching myself whatever is needed for a specific job. I am currently enrolled in the most advanced classes available at my grade level and maintain a 4.0 GPA. I am currently the Treasurer of our school’s nationally-ranked Model UN team and manage our team’s finances. I am also a member of the school’s varsity Science, Cross Country, and Track and Field teams. My experiences in school and as part of these organizations have further spurred my interests in STEM and given me valuable organizational and leadership skills.</p>
